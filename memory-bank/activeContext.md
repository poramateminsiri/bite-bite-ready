# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Memory Bank Initialization**: Establishing comprehensive project documentation to support ongoing development and maintenance of the Bite-Bite-Ready food ordering application.

## Recent Changes
- **Project Setup**: Initial project structure established with React frontend and Express backend
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed for both frontend and backend
- **Database**: SQLite database initialized with sample menu data
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library integrated and configured
- **Context System**: Menu and Cart contexts implemented for state management

## Next Steps
1. **Complete Memory Bank**: Finish initializing all core documentation files
2. **Feature Validation**: Verify all existing features work as expected
3. **Code Review**: Assess current implementation for improvements or optimizations
4. **Testing**: Ensure application stability and user experience quality

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Context API vs Redux**: Continuing with React Context API for simplicity given current project scope
- **SQLite vs PostgreSQL**: Maintaining SQLite for simplicity and easy deployment
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Fully committed to this component library for consistent design

### Development Preferences
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maintaining strict type checking for code quality
- **Component Organization**: Following established patterns in src/ directory structure
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### User Experience Priorities
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring all components work well on mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Implementing proper loading indicators for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages that don't expose technical details

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based Components**: Group related components in feature directories
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized type definitions in src/types/
- **Service Layer**: API calls abstracted through service layer in src/services/
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic extracted into reusable hooks

### Styling Patterns
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Consistent use of Tailwind classes for styling
- **Component Variants**: Using class-variance-authority for component variations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

### State Management
- **Context Composition**: Nesting providers in App.tsx for global state
- **Local State**: Using useState for component-specific state
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data with caching and synchronization

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **Vite Performance**: Significantly faster development experience compared to Create React App
- **shadcn/ui Flexibility**: Highly customizable components that maintain accessibility
- **SQLite Simplicity**: Easy to set up and deploy, perfect for this project scope
- **TypeScript Benefits**: Catching potential bugs at compile time, improving code quality

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend hot reload working effectively
- **Error Boundaries**: Need to implement proper error boundaries for production readiness
- **Loading States**: Current implementation could benefit from skeleton loaders

### User Experience Observations
- **Menu Display**: Current menu layout is functional but could be more visually appealing
- **Cart Interactions**: Add to cart functionality works well but lacks visual feedback
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design working but some touch targets could be larger

## Current Assumptions
- **Single Restaurant**: Application designed for single restaurant menu management
- **Local Development**: Both frontend and backend running on localhost
- **Sample Data**: Using seeded menu data for development and testing
- **No Authentication**: Current implementation doesn't include user authentication

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Complete Documentation**: Finish activeContext.md and progress.md
2. **Feature Testing**: Verify menu display and cart functionality
3. **Code Quality**: Run linting and fix any issues found
4. **Performance Check**: Assess initial load times and optimization opportunities
