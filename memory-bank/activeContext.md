  - Cart integration with order submission and success notifications
  - Transaction support for data integrity

- **Menu Detail Pages** (COMPLETED): Individual pages for each dish
  - New route: `/menu/:id` for dish-specific URLs
  - MenuDetail page component with full product information
  - Quantity selector with real-time total calculation
  - Breadcrumb navigation (Home > Menu > Dish Name)
  - Clickable menu cards with navigation
  - Loading states and 404 error handling
  - Mobile-responsive two-column layout

- **Database Enhancements**: Extended schema for orders

  - Indexes for optimal query performance
  - Foreign key constraints enabled

- **UI/UX Improvements**:
  - CheckoutForm component with order summary
  - Skeleton loaders for better loading states
  - Toast notifications for user feedback
  - Improved cart with clearCart functionality

## Next Steps
1. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing of order flow and menu detail pages
2. **Optional Enhancements**: Consider adding features like:
   - Customer reviews and ratings
   - Order history page
   - Admin dashboard for order management
   - Payment integration
   - Email notifications
3. **Performance Optimization**: Image optimization and lazy loading
4. **SEO Improvements**: Meta tags and structured data for menu items
5. **Analytics Integration**: Track user behavior and order metrics

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Architecture Decisions
- **Context API vs Redux**: Continuing with React Context API for simplicity given current project scope
- **SQLite vs PostgreSQL**: Maintaining SQLite for simplicity and easy deployment
- **shadcn/ui Integration**: Fully committed to this component library for consistent design

### Development Preferences
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: Maintaining strict type checking for code quality
- **Component Organization**: Following established patterns in src/ directory structure
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with consistent error handling

### User Experience Priorities
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensuring all components work well on mobile devices
- **Loading States**: Implementing proper loading indicators for better UX
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages that don't expose technical details

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- **Feature-based Components**: Group related components in feature directories
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized type definitions in src/types/
- **Service Layer**: API calls abstracted through service layer in src/services/
- **Custom Hooks**: Business logic extracted into reusable hooks

### Styling Patterns
- **Tailwind Utilities**: Consistent use of Tailwind classes for styling
- **Component Variants**: Using class-variance-authority for component variations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with responsive breakpoints

### State Management
- **Context Composition**: Nesting providers in App.tsx for global state
- **Local State**: Using useState for component-specific state
- **Server State**: TanStack Query for API data with caching and synchronization

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Technical Insights
- **Vite Performance**: Significantly faster development experience compared to Create React App
- **shadcn/ui Flexibility**: Highly customizable components that maintain accessibility
- **SQLite Simplicity**: Easy to set up and deploy, perfect for this project scope
- **TypeScript Benefits**: Catching potential bugs at compile time, improving code quality

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reload**: Both frontend and backend hot reload working effectively
- **Error Boundaries**: Need to implement proper error boundaries for production readiness
- **Loading States**: Current implementation could benefit from skeleton loaders

### User Experience Observations
- **Menu Display**: Enhanced with clickable cards that navigate to detail pages
- **Cart Interactions**: Fully functional with add, remove, update quantity, and clear cart
- **Mobile Experience**: Responsive design works well across devices
- **Order Flow**: Smooth checkout process with clear feedback and validation
- **Navigation**: Intuitive with breadcrumbs and back buttons
- **Detail Pages**: Large images and comprehensive product information improve conversion

## Current Assumptions
- **Single Restaurant**: Application designed for single restaurant menu management
- **Local Development**: Both frontend and backend running on localhost
- **Sample Data**: Using seeded menu data for development and testing
- **No Authentication**: Current implementation doesn't include user authentication

## Immediate Action Items
1. **Testing**: Test complete user journey from menu browse to order placement
2. **Code Quality**: Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined
3. **Documentation**: Keep memory bank updated as new features are added
4. **Deployment Preparation**: Prepare for production deployment when ready
