## Current Status

### Development Phase
**Early Implementation**: Core architecture established with functional foundation

### Stability Assessment
- **Frontend**: Stable with working components and state management
- **Backend**: Stable with database operations and API endpoints
- **Integration**: Frontend-backend communication working properly
- **Build Process**: Development and production builds functioning

### Performance Baseline
- **Initial Load**: Acceptable load times with current feature set
- **Runtime Performance**: Smooth interactions with React's concurrent features
- **Bundle Size**: Within acceptable limits for fast loading
- **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks detected in current implementation

## Known Issues

### üêõ Critical Issues
- **Error Boundaries**: No error boundaries implemented for graceful error handling
- **Loading States**: Missing loading indicators for API calls
- **Form Validation**: No client-side validation for user inputs

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium Issues
- **Mobile Touch Targets**: Some buttons may be too small on mobile devices
- **Image Loading**: No lazy loading implemented for food images
- **SEO**: No meta tags or structured data for search engines

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Minor Issues
- **TypeScript Strict**: Some type assertions may need refinement
- **Code Comments**: Limited inline documentation in complex functions
- **Test Coverage**: No unit or integration tests implemented

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (Maintained)
- **React + TypeScript**: Proven excellent for development experience and code quality
- **Vite Build Tool**: Significantly improved development speed and build performance
- **shadcn/ui Components**: Excellent choice for consistent, accessible UI components
